## JSON Diff Checker
Being a back-end developer and not writing any test case it's a common mistake that you'll probably break the JSON for your consumers. It's also quite common that they won't be matching in data types.

I was looking for some JSON diff checkers online but found nothing that works pretty much exactly I want.

So rather than spending a lots of time on Facebook, I started building a one for myself and assumed that this one may help others as well.

### How does it look?

### Installation
- An extension is available for Google Chrome.
- Otherwise, you can just clone the repository
    * `npm install` the dependencies.
    * `npm start` should start the project.

### Bugs?
Obviously, it's true that the app/extension may crash due to bugs. Please report an issue if you find any.

### PRs.
I'd probably like the PRs for the improvements and bug fixes.

Happy coding! <3
